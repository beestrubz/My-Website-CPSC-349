# My Website CPSC 349 

 ## Description
This is my submission for CPSC 349: Web Frontend Engineering. Through this project, I was able to get comfortable with the basics of HTML and CSS. This project also made me think a lot about my future and served as a great writing exercise. I will definitely use a lot of this material in a more refined version of my real website someday. It was fun making this, and I wish I could have fleshed it out more if time allowed.
