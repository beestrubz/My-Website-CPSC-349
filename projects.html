                <h2>Cowboys vs Robots (2021)</h2>
                <p>"Cowboys vs Robots" is one of my earliest game development projects,
                     and it’s what ignited my passion for the field. Inspired by games 
                     like Plants vs Zombies, this top-down defense game marked my 
                     introduction to the Unity game engine and asset creation.</p>
                <p>As a solo developer, managing all the roles in the game development
                     pipeline was a challenge. I wondered, "How can I find time not only
                      to code but also to create the art for my game?" This question led 
                      me to explore pixel art. Not only was it a classic style, but it 
                      also simplified my workload when creating sprites and animations. 
                      So, I downloaded Aseprite and began learning how to create pixel art.</p>

                <h2>Milos Whisker Wonders (2023)</h2>
                <p>Now this project was a fun one. Milo’s Whisker Wonders was created during
                     my junior year of college when I first transferred to Cal State Fullerton.
                      This game was developed for my Foundations of Software Engineering course
                       where we were tasked to create any piece of software we’d like but it had
                        to be a group project. I pitched an idea of a cat-inspired 2D-pixel art 
                        platformer to a group and was able to find 3 other students who were 
                        interested in the idea. </p>
                <p>Over the span of two months, we collaborated to bring the game to life, 
                    ultimately publishing Milo’s Whisker Wonders on Itch.io. This project 
                    was a tremendous learning experience, teaching me essential skills like
                     version control with GitHub, publishing a game, and navigating teamwork
                      dynamics. Additionally, the class introduced me to software engineering
                       practices such as scrum meetings, agile development methodologies, and
                        sprint planning—knowledge that continues to shape my approach to 
                        future projects. I still consider this class the most valuable I’ve
                         taken during my college career and I am so glad I took this course.</p>

                <h2>Vesper's Edge (2025)</h2>
                <p>Vesper’s Edge is my current project, set in a distant future where players 
                    take on the role of an astronaut landing on the mysterious planet Vesper. 
                    Through intricate puzzle mechanics and fluid player movement, the goal is
                     to uncover the secrets of Vesper through a tight engaging narrative.</p>
                <p>Unlike my previous projects, this marks my transition to 3D game development
                     and Unreal Engine 5. Development for this project begins in January 2025. 
                     For this project, I am acting as the Project Lead and Technical Artist. As
                      the Project Lead, I am responsible for guiding our team of five, ensuring
                       we stay on schedule, and preparing for a Steam launch in May 2025. 
                       Additionally, my role as the Technical Artist will have me creating 3D
                        assets in Blender and ensuring the models work correctly in Unreal Engine. </p>
                <p>Vesper’s Edge also serves as my Senior Capstone Project, and we aim to showcase
                     it at Cal State Fullerton’s 2025 ECS Student Project Expo, with the goal of
                      winning the competition award. So far we have a tech demo which you can view here. 
                      The purpose of this tech demo was just to get practice with premade assets, test puzzle mechanics
                       and familiarize ourself with the Unreal Engine itself.
