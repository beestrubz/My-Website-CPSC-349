                <h2><i>A Day Outside the Office</i> (Coming Summer 2025)</h2>
                <p><i>A Day Outside the Office</i> is a whimsical sci-fi adventure that follows
                     you—an alien mission dispatcher stuck behind a desk, assigning thrilling 
                     galactic missions to others while never leaving the office yourself. 
                     Tired of the monotony of your work life—sitting in a cubicle all day 
                     and watching others blast off into the stars—you seize the chance to
                      “borrow” a ship and embark on your own adventure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But things quickly go off course when the ship you stole had a
                     faulty battery, causing you to crash-land on a mysterious planet. 
                     To make it back in time, you’ll need to solve environmental challenges,
                    befriend strange inhabitants, and recover the missing pieces of your
                    ship—all before your boss notices you’re missing from your desk!

                </p>

                <p>Unlike my previous projects, this marks my transition to 3D game development
                     and Unreal Engine 5. Development for this project begins in January 2025. 
                     For this project, I serve as both the Project Lead and Technical Artist.
                </p>
                <p> 
                     In my role as a Project Lead, I guide our five-person team, manage the schedule, 
                     handle marketing and licensing compliance, and lead preparations for our planned Steam launch in summer 2025.
                    Additionally, my role as the Technical Artist will have me creating 3D
                    assets in Blender and ensuring the models work correctly in Unreal Engine.

                <h2><i>Milo's Whisker Wonders</i> (2023)</h2>
                <p><i>Milo’s Whisker Wonders</i> was created during
                     my junior year of college when I first transferred to Cal State Fullerton.
                      This game was developed for my Foundations of Software Engineering course
                       where we were tasked to create any piece of software we’d like but it had
                        to be a group project. I pitched the idea of a cat-inspired 2D-pixel art 
                        platformer and was able to find 3 other students who were 
                        interested in the idea. </p>
                <p>Over the span of two months, we collaborated to bring the game to life, 
                    ultimately publishing <i>Milo’s Whisker Wonders</i> on Itch.io. This project 
                    was a tremendous learning experience, teaching me essential skills like
                     version control with GitHub, publishing a game, and navigating teamwork
                      dynamics. Additionally, the class introduced me to software engineering
                       practices such as scrum meetings, agile development methodologies, and
                        sprint planning—knowledge that continues to shape my approach to 
                        future projects. I still consider this class the most valuable I’ve
                         taken during my college career and I am so glad I took this course.</p>

                <h2><i>Cowboys vs Robots</i> (2021)</h2>
                <p><i>Cowboys vs Robots</i> was one of my earliest game development projects
                     and it’s what ignited my passion for the field. Inspired by games 
                     like Plants vs Zombies, this top-down defense game marked my 
                     introduction to the Unity game engine and asset creation.</p>
                <p>As a solo developer, managing all the roles in the game development
                     pipeline was a challenge. I wondered, "How can I find time not only
                      to code but also to create the art for my game?" This question led 
                      me to explore pixel art. Not only was it a classic style, but it 
                      also simplified my workload when creating sprites and animations. 
                      So, I downloaded Aseprite and began learning how to create pixel art.</p>
