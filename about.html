                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by! I’m Brandon, a student at Cal State
                     Fullerton finishing up my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
                     I’m someone who loves artistic expression—whether it’s playing the guitar,
                      dabbling with keys, or watching animated films. I also, am an avid lover
                      of the outdoors as it inspires me. However, I’m equally fascinated by the
                       nerdy technical stuff. I’m always asking myself, “How does that thing work
                        the way it does?”. I am a lifelong learner and I  love learning to
                         skills. That curiosity led me to study Computer Science,
                         where I would get the opportunity to build cool software. </p>
                <p> But it was not just any software that excited me—no, it was video games. 
                    I love playing video games, and I also love to watch documentaries and read
                     about how games were made. Simply put: I love games, so I want to make them!
                      But I’ve always wondered—how can I combine my love for visual arts, like
                       animation, with the technical magic of programming? That question led me
                        to the role of a Technical Artist, someone who bridges the gap between art
                         and technology. A Technical Artist ensures that creative visions come to 
                         life by optimizing workflows, solving technical challenges, and blending 
                         artistic creativity with programming expertise. </p>
                <p>Traditional schooling taught me the theory: coding, algorithms, and all that good
                     computer science stuff. But making video games? That’s something I’ve been teaching
                      myself in my free time. I began creating 2D-pixel art games in 2019 using the Unity
                       game engine, learning through YouTube tutorials and online forums. Fast forward to
                        today, I’ve transitioned to developing immersive 3D experiences, crafting assets
                         in Blender, and bringing them to life with Unreal Engine.</p>
